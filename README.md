Alhamdulillah,
We have done our Java Swing project (Desktop Application) in Java course under the supervision of Md Jehadul Islam Mony Sir. 
Our project name is LU Alumni Association. With this software: 
1. Anyone can create an account and then log in, logout 
2. See other's profiles with all information including profile picture, LinkedIn and Github profile 
3. Can search by using name, location, tech stack 
4. Can update any field of their own profile 
5. Can delete their own profile

All the fields contain regex validation. So there is no option of submitting invalid information. We have used Java Swing along with MySQL for database, and row Java code for functionalities.
The coding part was handled by me Shah Sayem Ahmad and Abu Sufian Rafi. The planning, UI design, and UX design were done by Fariha Rahman, Farjana Khan  and Numan Ahmed Rony.
Thanks everyone for your kind contribution.
(N. B: For security issues, we do not use actual data of individuals in our project.)
